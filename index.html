  <span> A very late birthday present! But also a way for us to keep talking in an extra way </span> <span>while you're off in France doing great things. </span> <span>I know we have each other's numbers but we suck at texting and I </span> <span> thought letters suit us both better. Of course we can still text and call, </span> <span> this is just a more aesthetic way to talk to each other. I also thought it </span> <span> would make it easier to talk regularly 'cause we can each </span> <span> write a letter for example once every two weeks (or whatever we have time for lol) </span> <span> and dump whatever we have had to say during that time all in one place.
